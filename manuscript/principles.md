# Principles

## First, principles.

Too often we start with tools. The derisive terms "Buzzword Bingo" and "Resume Driven Development" have been coined to describe this phenomena and tendency in our line of work. At the risk of over-explaining, the subtext is that tools come and go and won't save your lunch.

When principles drive our choice of practices, practices stick. When practices stick, we get really good at picking and mastering the right tools. Better to act from first principles. 

## What's a principle?

> Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value. - Stephen Covey

Bret Victor gives us a nice example of principles in his talk, [Inventing on Principle](https://www.notion.so/d959a994-4c12-46a9-8cb6-ab6affef11cf). 

"Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating," he asserts as his principle. He goes on to demonstrate a gaming IDE where programmatic changes are seen side-by-side with gameplay mechanics. It is *very* cool.

His core message is about the role that principles play in the act of creation. His principle, for example, helps him anchor on and realize a fundamental value: instant feedback.

## Dojo Principles

It's tempting to describe the Dojo model in static terms, saying, "here are a bunch of workflow diagrams, figures, and text and here is the binder that contains it all now enjoy your certificate of achievement." However that outcome is precisely *not* my goal. 

There are several core principles that guide the inception and evolution of a successful Dojo challenge or program. I use these principles to evolve models large and small, not the other way around. 

### Psychological Safety
Team members must be OK with failure as an option.

### Product Mindset
Product thinking as a manageable entry to systems thinking.

### Context Rich Environment
Better context yields better content.

### Dynamic Collaboration
Beyond pairing: situational, purposeful collaboration across roles.

### Planning With Feedback
Feedback-driven planning loops: build, measure, learn.

### Learning Forward
Dial back delivery to amplify learning. Progress is a side-effect of progression.

### Real Work 
Working through real problems, not simulations or contrived examples, makes for a better learning experience.

### Balanced Teams
T-shaped people building T-shaped teams.

### Committed & Engaged
You get out of a Dojo challenge what you put into it.

These are just a starting point. You'll likely discovery principles that work better in your situation.
