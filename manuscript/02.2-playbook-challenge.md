## Framing, Mapping, Planning

Principles: [Balanced Teams](https://www.notion.so/8d0e3eb3-3407-4e5b-a4ea-7fad3dddf00e), [Dynamic Collaboration](https://www.notion.so/2e3d3360-ad52-455f-8d5d-8073fa082c3d), [Product Mindset](https://www.notion.so/1967ad47-5680-4bc2-a5bb-ab053fec58d5)

Every dojo challenge begins with a framing session. This session can take 2-4 hours depending on the size of the team, the clarity of mission coming in, and the ambitions of the team members.

It's not the frame, it's the process of framing. It isn't a one time exercise, it is an iterative tool used to calibrate the team's journey toward setting and achieving their goals.

#### Framing {#framing}

- Paper prototype SPoG (Single Pane of Glass) for the team.
- OKRs for the product development team.
- A formation event for coaches to understand where the product community is.
- As a tool for the team and coaches to understand how [Balanced Teams](https://www.notion.so/8d0e3eb3-3407-4e5b-a4ea-7fad3dddf00e) they really are.
- An iterative tool that captures team refinement and evolving focus.

Framing components: 

##### Name {#framing-name}

Literal names.

Short: 3-5 words.

A new name - different than before.

##### Expiration {#framing-expiration}

6-weeks or the length of your challenge.

This tells us when to return to the frame, though we will often reference the frame.

Normally I say 2-10 weeks.

Some teams decide to expire w/in challenge as a trigger to revisit.

Framing is iterative!

Our expiration will guide [Objectives & Measures](https://www.notion.so/e50bdd88-f717-41f4-b7f0-433005945909) as a healthy constraint; we want to select measures that are observable within the expiration we set.

##### Pitch {#framing-pitch}

aka *Mission Brief, Elevator Pitch*

**Timing:** 30-minutes.

A short writing exercise to communicate our team's purpose in the dojo. Our pitch helps us communicate our overall mission and vision for our team to both (1) one another, (2) our support community, and (3) people and groups outside of the dojo.

The pitch should satisfy a few questions.

- What do you want to learn? The words "learn" or "learning" should show up in the pitch.
- How do you envision you'll end up as a team? What's the end state?
- What skills will typify you as a team post-ojo?

Writing as a group can be hard. Suddenly we, a bunch of technologists, are thrust into a Hollywood writer's room. It can feel unnatural.

I have a few techniques for getting groups unstuck with this:

1. Break up to groups and write a pitch for 15 minutes. Deliver the pitches. Select the best parts of each pitch to synthesize into a final pitch.
2. [Message Map: How To Pitch Anything In 15 Seconds](https://www.notion.so/c076e1cd-6061-49bf-a07a-ee7f82c566de) - I've used this technique for structuring the mission. Essentially it's an outlining technique.
3. [Aaron Pugh - Business Plan Competition Pitch Champion](https://www.notion.so/7a5ac6d9-a23d-4d8e-830e-a086d0a828dd) - Sometimes I'll play this. Aaron's pitch is just awesome and I'll write down the elements of his pitch: problem, pain/gain, solution, strategies/tactics, value and ROI for investors.

##### Skill Inventory {#skill-inventory}

Skills over roles. Acknowledge Ed's riff here...

These are a list of first principle-type skills: Testing, Architecture/Design, Collaboration, Refactoring, Coding, Sketching, etc. Our current idea is that we set these conditions, not going all the way into practices (TDD and Pairing for example), and leave a few slots for the team to generate their own skills. They'd have to make choices on this.

These skills tee up the [capabilities](#{capabilities}) we're offering as a dojo program.

The legend: Got it / Want it / Can teach it / No comment

People on the left side. Would love to use an Instax camera here so we have people's faces with names. It's always hard to learn a dozen new names every 3 weeks.

Question here is to stack the deck with a few skills - Testing, CI, Coding, etc.

Maybe also limit the number of skills a team can put on their (choices)

Talk about gaps. Talk about collaboration opportunities
