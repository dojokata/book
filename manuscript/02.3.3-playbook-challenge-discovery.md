## Discovery
Discovery, or more completely, Product Discovery, is a method for creating deeper understandings of your end users in the pursuit of delivering the solutions that they truly need. Product Discovery is the embodiment of achieving a Product Mindset, which is a fundamental principle and desired outcome of the dojo experience. A Product Discovery session front ends a dojo challenge, but also becomes a continuously applied and reflective process that is repeated, as warranted, during the challenge, to generate further customer learnings. 

There are several interconnected practices we have come to rely on to form the essential core practices that is Product Discovery; Personas, Story Mapping/C4 Modeling, Journeying, and Example Mapping. Each practice is intended to produce an output that serves as a downstream input to the follow-on practice. It should be noted, however, that the specific practices applied within the discovery process can vary or adapt depending on the team's mission context and needs. For example, Domain Driven Design, Event Storming, Google Design Sprints, just to name a few, are possible additional and/or alternative practices.
