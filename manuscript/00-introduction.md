"Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own." - Bruce Lee

“We are uncovering new ways of working by doing it,” so begins the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, now going on two decades old. The declaration goes on to define several attributes that teams might focus on, but it’s this first part, the part that hints at evolving workflow by doing and reflecting on that workflow, that’s at the core of the dojo model.

Getting to agility takes investment - time, money, attention. Most of all it takes intent. Transformation is hard to do when the wardrum of delivery is pounding away. Metrics such as velocity, capacity, etc. have their place, but don't tell us a lot about how much learning we're doing.

The Dojo Model is about tranformation through learning by doing.
