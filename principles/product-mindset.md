# Product Mindset

Products are like little systems unto themselves. We see products as ways of carving out little boundaries so we can reason about systems. That is, a product mindset is valuable in forming teams that can reason about an entire system.

### What's a Product?

Mike Cohn [wrote up a nice definition](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-is-a-product) by way of product attributes.

Back in the day it was about aligning business with technology. Product thinking gave us a new focus and set of mandates:

* What about the user?
* Maybe you should get out of the building to discover stuff about your customer.
* etc.

### Supporting Practices

Intake - In which we confront the idea of product vs. project as a way of self-assessing how we're doing in this area.
