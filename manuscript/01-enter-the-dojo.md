-# Enter the Dojo

A dojo a space for immersive learning. A team enters the dojo for a period of time, usually six weeks, is paired with skilled coaches and pursues balanced goals, identifies success metrics, and iterates rapidly, sharing their real work and learnings.

That's a lot to unpack, so let's do that step-by-step.

Dojo challenge takes a whole product development team through a 6-week challenge where they slow down delivery but work thoughtfully through a product impact while accumulating new skills. In a challenge the team iterates very quickly, twice a week. The team sets learning goals that balance various product dimensions (viability, desirability, feasibility, sustainability, et. al.). During the challenge the team collaborates with one or more expert player coaches who has mastery of the skills the team would like to learn.

#### Disambiguation

There are many overloaded terms in technology, service and component, to name a few. I'm afraid dojo is about to fall into the same bucket. For our purposes dojo means a model for developing a learning culture, team by team. 

A coding dojo is a well-established concept in which a group of developers will come together to practice their coding chops. A variant of this is [Coderetreat](https://www.notion.so/d01f7f4c-f3a2-448b-a545-58885a22d6a5) - where developers follow a series of simple rules to explore problem solving socially and with constraints. While coding dojos like this are valuable from a skills development perspective, they tend to focus on a single role such as engineer rather than the whole. They also don't incorporate a team's real work, which we'll see is an important quality in the dojo we describe.

A kata, literally *form* in Japanese, is another concept from the world of programming. A coding kata is something you practice over and over until it becomes rote. There are many examples of Katas often set to electronic music, often to dubstep. Again: valuable but limited to technical skills.

If these terms bother you, you should feel free to call your dojo a space mission or program, accelerator, or something cultural-specific. I use the term dojo because they're known in the industry, not out of any particular affinity for martial arts.

## What makes dojos work?

Let's start with doesn't work and why. Training workshops, especially the 2-day variety, help build awareness and basic capability, but they fail when attendees go back to their home teams and are confronted with the usual tyranny of the urgent. It's hard to place new knowledge into practice, when you're overcome by the status quo.

Focus on process and utlization metrics gets in the way of . Learning is job #1.

Energizing workplace.

Teams level up together instead of relying on one or two heroes or ringers.

Ultimately it's the people in the dojo and a dojo challenge that determine success. Is your leadership behind the effort and involved? Are your coaches capable and collaborating elbow to elbow with the teams? Is the team commited, engaged, and curious during the period of their challenge?

## Why might you care?

2x teams not 10x developers. Directionally measurable improvement. Learning to improve.

Build your existing capability over putting all your hopes on that next, perfect future hire.

It seems that we put learning first we get all kinds of positive side-effects such as faster delivery, more impactful products, etc.

It's a more effective way to engage coaches.

Coaches like it because variables/noise that interrupt coaching are controlled/is filtered.

## Where does the idea and practice come from?

Dojo is a borrowed term from Japanese meaning "the place of the way." In martial arts, a dojo is a practice space, a place for learning. 

The dojo model, as it's described here, started and gained traction at retail giant Target. They still have [their dojo up and running](https://dojo.target.com/). Many people have toured their rather impressive facility. 

In the early days of the Target Dojo, I was fortunate to consult with their program as a head coach. Much of what you're about to read comes from the many experiments and learnings from this time. I was hired to help Target scale their dojo to 12 concurrent teams. My colleague, Joel Tosi, and I adapted what we learned from our shared mentor, [David Hussman](https://www.google.com/search?q=david+hussman&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr), to help structure Target's dojo program, their approach to coaching, and figuring out how scale the program. As coaches we brought a lot of experience and ideas to the table, and, with the collaboration of a seriously incredible team at Target, what we now think of as a dojo took shape and grew.

Since this time, I've consulted with several Fortune 500 companies on building similar programs. After many repetitions, a small community of coaches are converging on a set of principles, a playbook, and common scenarios. Now seems like the time to begin documenting this, as the approach gains popularity and a community begins to grow. 

## Who is this book written for?

This book was written for the segments in an organization that need to come together to make a dojo work:

- Leaders: value of the dojo approach and how to pilot a dojo program.
- Coaches: lays out the program so you can adapt your coaching style to the needs of the form.
- Teams: contains valuable reference and how to.

It's for teams. It's for coaches. It's for people sick of overly prescriptive process and organizations that focus on the wrong things. I see this as a powerful model for teams to begin creating their own customized workflows and jettison much of the process prescription that has become associated with agile methodologies. Agile does not need to suck.

## What motivated you to write this book?

This book is meant to be a living document. My intent is to share ideas on how you might create and operate your own dojos. After reading this book and engaging with other practitioners in the community, there is no reason (outside of corporate obstacles) you shouldn't be able to pop up a dojo challenge for your own team.

## How should I read this book?

TL;DR - Any way you want!

This section, "Enter the Dojo," describes the core elements of the dojo, the basics. If you're new to the concept, I'd start here so you have a grounding in the terminology and foundational elements of a successful dojo.
