“We are uncovering new ways of working by doing it,” so begins the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/). This two-decades-plus old declaration goes on to define several attributes that teams might focus on, but it’s this first part &mdash; the part that hints at evolving workflow by doing work, reflecting on the outcomes of what you did, and making adjustments &mdash; that makes the manifesto relevant today.

The lead up text of the Agile manifesto is the only part that hints at the role of learning in software development. Learning, as it turns out, is inseperable from the act of creating modern digital products. We know this as evidence by other popular movements and communities:

* Learning about our customers: Design Thinking and Lean Startup communities popularized user-centered design, customer development, and a product thinking mindset.
* Learning about our systems: Topics emerging from the DevOps community such as observability and chaos engineering furnish us with novel practices and roles such as event-based tracing, service level objectives, and resilience engineering.
* Learning about our domains: Domain Driven Design and Test-driven Development have programmers model and change codebases as new knowledge or insight becomes available.
