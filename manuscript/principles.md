# 10 Dojo Principles

## First, principles.

Too often we start with tools. The derisive terms "Buzzword Bingo" and "Resume Driven Development" have been coined to describe this phenomena and tendency in our line of work. At the risk of over-explaining, the subtext is that tools come and go and won't save your lunch.

When principles drive our choice of practices, practices stick. When practices stick, we get really good at picking and mastering the right tools. Better to act from first principles. 

## What, then, is a principle?

> Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value. - Stephen Covey

Bret Victor gives us a nice example of principles in his talk, [Inventing on Principle](https://www.notion.so/d959a994-4c12-46a9-8cb6-ab6affef11cf). 

"Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating," he asserts as his principle. He goes on to demonstrate a gaming IDE where programmatic changes are seen side-by-side with gameplay mechanics. It is *very* cool.

His core message is about the role that principles play in the act of creation. His principle, for example, helps him anchor on and realize a fundamental value: instant feedback.

## The Dojo Principles

It's tempting to describe the Dojo model in static terms, saying, "here are a bunch of workflow diagrams, figures, and text and here is the binder that contains it all now enjoy your certificate of achievement." However that outcome is precisely *not* my goal. 

There are ten, core principles that guide the inception and evolution of a successful Dojo challenge or program. I use these principles to evolve models large and small, not the other way around. 

### Psychological Safety

Team members must be OK with failure as an option.

### Product Mindset

Product thinking as a manageable entry to systems thinking. Products differ from projects in many ways. Three of the more important differentiators are (1) focus on a user, (2) team continuity, and, (3) how they are measured.

### Context Rich Environments

Better context yields better content. A big part of the dojo is space and the visuals we plaster the walls with.

**In the dojo we place a high importance on the visibility of system status.** This means we can see work-in-progress, maps and our journeys through these maps, metrics dashboards, and the overall compass of the team.

### Dynamic Collaboration

Beyond pairing: situational, purposeful collaboration across roles.

### Planning With Feedback

Feedback-driven planning loops: build, measure, learn. The goal of planning is to set a course for the entire team. The goal of feedback is to learn whether or not that course is the right one.

**In the dojo, we both plan to create moments of feedback and make smarter decisions about our ideas with the benefit of feedback.** We want our planning to be effective so we are extreme and serious in shortening feedback loops. Planning chicken, meet feedback egg. We do this to design and develop the right thing for our users and customers.

### Learning Forward

Dial back delivery to amplify learning. Progress is a side-effect of progression.

**In the dojo we put learning above things like velocity and capacity.**

### Real Work 

Working through real problems, not simulations or contrived examples, makes for a better learning experience. It's not that there's anything wrong with using LEGOÂ® Elements to simulate concepts for understanding, it's just that's not how we roll.

**In the dojo we work on your work, slowly, consciously, and methodically at first until we gain comfort with the skills we are learning permitting speed.** We will occasionally examine models from our industry and others, but immediately apply that context to our own. Realism is the central concept in the dojo learning style.

### Balanced Teams

T-shaped people build T-shaped teams. A T-shaped person has a number of core capabilities and skills needed to pull off valuable product impacts. They're a bit like TV's MacGyver, bricoleurs able to assemble readily available material into surprisingly complex solutions. The mullet is optional.

**In the dojo balanced teams pursue outcomes that lead to sustainable systems, happy customers, teammate progression, and simple, effective technology.** Delivery of business value is one such outcome. Other outcomes include paying back technical debt and understanding the customer better. Teams are encouraged to find the right balance of goals to pursue appropriate for product and themselves.

### Committed & Engaged

You get out of a Dojo challenge what you put into it. I think the common enemies standing between a lot of teams and progression are apathy and inertia. "We'll never have time to do that," becomes an excuse for living with cumbersome workflow and code people are afraid to change or challenge. 

**In the dojo we seek to exchange apathy for grit and inertia for energy.** The dojo model creates the conditions for learning and progression, but commitment by the team, their supporting community, and coaches is what guarantees a meaningful, impactful challenge experience.

### Do It Yourself

These principles are just a starting point. In learning, you'll likely discovery principles that work better for your situation.We encourage you to curate your own principles as you grow into experience. This kind of DIY spirit is simper important.

**In the dojo we practice critical thinking and operate from first principles.** If something isn't working we jettison it. If we discover something that works better, we refine it. There are no sacred cows here, only learning, experimentation, and situational awareness.
