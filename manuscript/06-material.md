- 60”+ 4k Display w/ HDMI input. SMART displays are overkill; we generally want to display our workstation screens and switch the display quickly as we share.
- Dedicated environments or cloud accounts to be able to create environments (with secrets vault / credentials). The lead time associated with ticket storms asking for resources usually menas a slow start.
- 27” monitors (res?) for pairing. HDMI input because it's 2019.
- Bin of adapters for everything (VGA, Display Port, USB-C) to HDMI.
- A long enough HDMI cable to reach anywhere in the space.
- 4x 4’x8’ Dry Erase Board
- Tables, Floor-plan TBD
