# Enter the Dojo

What's a dojo?

## Origin Story

Dojo is a borrowed term from Japanese (道場) meaning "the place of the way." 

In martial arts, Dojo is a practice space, a place for learning. Regardless of how you feel about the metaphor, the term translates to our purpose well enough.

The Dojo model started and gained traction at retail giant Target. They still have [their Dojo up and running](#) and many people have toured their rather impressive facility. 

In the early days of the Target Dojo, I was fortunate to serve as a Head Coach. Much of what you're about to read comes from the many experiments and learnings we had during this time. I was hired to help Target scale their Dojo to 10 concurrent teams. My colleague, Joel Tosi, and I adapted what we learned from our mentor, [David Hussman](https://www.notion.so/0c18b781-9544-4f09-9866-b3c29a0673ba), to help structure Dojo challenges and figure out how scale the program. 

I like to apply ideas from Kaizen culture and The Toyota Way. Many ideas in here and a lot of the practice tracks very closely with this and other elements of Lean thinking. As coaches we brought a lot of experience and ideas to the table, and, with the collaboration of a great internal team at Target, what we now think of as a Dojo was born.

## Today

By most measures the Target Dojo is a success. It's not often you see programs at scale that focus on learning take hold in the enterprise or anywhere for that matter. 

Since my time there, I have consulted with several companies on building a similar programs. After many repetitions, I've converged on a set of principles, a playbook, and a few challenge themes that seem to repeat themselves across Dojos Programs and Dojo Challenges. 

This resource is meant to be a living document. My intent is to share ideas on how you might create and operate your own Dojos. I see this as a powerful model for teams to begin creating their own customized workflows and jettison much of the process prescription that has become associated with agile methodologies. Agile does not need to suck.

## Disambiguation

For our purposes Dojo Kata means a model for developing a Kaizen culture at a team level.

There are many overloaded terms in technology, service and component, to name a couple obvious ones. I'm afraid Dojo and Kata are about to fall into this bucket.

A coding dojo is a well-established concept in which a group of developers will come together to practice their coding chops. A variant of this is [Coderetreat](https://www.notion.so/d01f7f4c-f3a2-448b-a545-58885a22d6a5) - where developers follow a series of simple rules to explore problem solving socially and with constraints. While coding dojos like this are valuable from a skills development perspective, they tend to focus on a single role or discipline rather than the whole. 

A kata, literally *form* in Japanese, is another concept from the world of programming. A coding kata is something you practice over and over until it becomes rote. There are many examples of Katas often set to electronic music, often to dubstep. Again: valuable but limited to development skills.

## Intended Audience
It's for teams. It's for coaches. It's for people sick of overly prescriptive process and organizations that focus on the wrong things. 

But mostly this book is for me. My motivations are selfish. I am coaching and consulting on Dojo programs at very large companies these days. I'd like for that advice to come from a living document so my advice seems less arbitrary. It is not arbitrary. It's grounded in lots of experimentaiton over time, and I think the only way to prove that is to document my POV over time. I expect my clients to expect this of me: non-arbitrariness.

I'm writing this with 10-15 year younger (and less experienced) version of myself in mind. When I reached for "eXtreme Programming Explained" it was like the skys parted. I needed some kind of process to develop a software-intensive product. That book, more than any other, has influenced the way draw on today. It was incredibly well written, lucid and clear.
