Start here to learn basic dojo concepts and vocabulary.

### **Challenge**

The 6-week period of time in which a team is in the Dojo.

### **Intake**

aka *Onboarding*

A session to prepare a team before they enter the Dojo.

### **Frame**

aka *Charter*

Collaborative and living document that steers the product development team. It is part team dashboard and part product hypothesis.

### **Challenge** **Team**

aka *Team, Mission Team*

The team and coach(es) engaged and dedicated to a Challenge.

### **Support Community**

The larger community supporting a challenge team. Supporters come from several segments: users, shared capabilities, colleagues, and other stakeholders.

### **Iteration**

aka *Sprint, Cadence*

Different than a Scrum sprint: much less ceremonious.
