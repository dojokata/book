# Enter the Dojo

THIS IS THREE BOOKS AND ONE SCREEN:

Coaching Manual - aka the Dungeon Master's Guide + Screen
Leadership Checklist - aka the Dungeon Master's Screen
The Dojo Standard - aka the Player's Guide
The Dojo Playbook - aka the Monster Manual, a binder/index


“We are uncovering new ways of working by doing it,” so begins the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, now going on two decades old. The declaration goes on to define several attributes that teams might focus on, but it’s this first part, the part that hints at evolving workflow by doing and reflecting on that workflow, that’s at the core of the dojo model.

A Dojo is a six week deep dive where a team sets balanced goals, identifies success metrics, and iterates rapidly, sharing their real work and learnings all while supported by dedicated, expert coaches.

That's a lot to unpack, so let's do that step-by-step:

- A Dojo challenge takes a whole team through a 6-week period of time.
- During this time prioritize learning over delivery predictability.
- The team iterates twice a week.
- The team sets learning goals that balance various product dimensions (viability, desirability, feasibility, sustainability, etc.)
- The team is supported by an expert in what they're trying to learn. An expert that brings strong coaching skills to the challenge.

## Why Dojos Work

Let's start with doesn't work and why. Training workshops, especially the 2-day variety, help build awareness and basic capability, but they fail when attendees go back to their home teams and are confronted with the usual tyranny of the urgent. It's hard to place new knowledge into practice, when you're overcome by the status quo.

Focus on process and utlization metrics doesn't work. Learning is job #1.

Energizing workplace.

## What's in it for me?

2x teams not 10x developers. Directionally measurable improvement. Learning to improve.

Build your existing capability over putting all your hopes on that next, perfect future hire.

It seems that we put learning first we get all kinds of positive side-effects such as faster delivery, more impactful products, etc.

It's a more effective way to engage coaches.

Coaches like it because variables/noise that interrupt coaching are controlled/is filtered.

## A Dojo Origin Story

Dojo is a borrowed term from Japanese meaning "the place of the way." In martial arts, Dojo is a practice space, a place for learning. Regardless of how you feel about the metaphor, the term translates to our purpose well enough.

The Dojo model started and gained traction at retail giant Target. They still have [their Dojo up and running](#) and many people have toured their rather impressive facility. 

In the early days of the Target Dojo, I was fortunate to serve as a Head Coach. Much of what you're about to read comes from the many experiments and learnings we had during this time. I was hired to help Target scale their Dojo to 10 concurrent teams. My colleague, Joel Tosi, and I adapted what we learned from our mentor, [David Hussman](https://www.notion.so/0c18b781-9544-4f09-9866-b3c29a0673ba), to help structure Dojo challenges and figure out how scale the program. As coaches we brought a lot of experience and ideas to the table, and, with the collaboration of a great internal team at Target, what we now think of as a Dojo was born.

INSPIRATION SECTION? I like to apply ideas from Kaizen culture and The Toyota Way. Many ideas in here and a lot of the practice tracks very closely with this and other elements of Lean thinking.

By most measures the Target Dojo is a success. It's not often you see programs at scale that focus on learning take hold in the enterprise or anywhere for that matter. 

Since my time there, I have consulted with several companies on building similar programs. After many repetitions, I've converged on a set of principles, a playbook, and a few challenge themes that seem to repeat themselves across Dojos Programs and Dojo Challenges. 

## Disambiguation

For our purposes Dojo Kata means a model for developing a Kaizen culture at a team level.

There are many overloaded terms in technology, service and component, to name a couple obvious ones. I'm afraid Dojo and Kata are about to fall into this bucket.

A coding dojo is a well-established concept in which a group of developers will come together to practice their coding chops. A variant of this is [Coderetreat](https://www.notion.so/d01f7f4c-f3a2-448b-a545-58885a22d6a5) - where developers follow a series of simple rules to explore problem solving socially and with constraints. While coding dojos like this are valuable from a skills development perspective, they tend to focus on a single role or discipline rather than the whole. 

A kata, literally *form* in Japanese, is another concept from the world of programming. A coding kata is something you practice over and over until it becomes rote. There are many examples of Katas often set to electronic music, often to dubstep. Again: valuable but limited to development skills.

If these terms bother you, you should feel free to call your dojo a space mission or program, accelerator, or something cultural-specific. I use the term dojo because they're becoming a thing in the industry, not out of any particular affinity for martial arts.

## Audience

Who should benefit and how:

- Leaders: value of the dojo approach and how to pilot a dojo program.
- Coaches: lays out the program so you can adapt your coaching style to the needs of the form.
- Teams: contains valuable reference and how to.

It's for teams. It's for coaches. It's for people sick of overly prescriptive process and organizations that focus on the wrong things. I see this as a powerful model for teams to begin creating their own customized workflows and jettison much of the process prescription that has become associated with agile methodologies. Agile does not need to suck.

## Book Goals

This resource is meant to be a living document. My intent is to share ideas on how you might create and operate your own Dojos. After reading this book and engaging with other practitioners in the community, there is no reason (outside of corporate obstacles) you shouldn't be able to pop up a dojo challenge for your own team.

Some of my motivations are selfish. I coach and consult on Dojo programs at very large companies these days. I'd like for that seem less arbitrary. It is not arbitrary. It only seems that way because it's in my head. The ideas presented here are grounded in a lots of experimentation and practice and time. The only way to scale and grow this thing is to document POV over time.
