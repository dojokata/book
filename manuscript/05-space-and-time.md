# Space and Time

In this section we'll talk about the importance of dedicated space and the duration of a dojo challenge.

A big part of the dojo experience and why it works is the space. Having a dedicated team space can feel envigorating and energizing, especially coming from a cube farm or open office environment. 

This space can also provide a healthy separation from normal routine. The isolation becomes a forcing function for Do It Yourself.

A dedicated space takes the team out of its normal environment and puts them in a new, more distraction free, environment that promotes focus.

The idea of a team room isn’t a new one. It’s been in the agile playbook for a long time. Before all this even was the Toyota Way idea of a [Obeya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obeya).

- A dedicated room is preferred. You do not want the challenge team’s space to be something walked through or routine. It's desirable to get people outside of their normal environment.
- Lots of wall space - we’re going to put up all kinds of displays and information radiators. We need space for things like frames, maps, etc.
- Readily available power outlets with tidy cable management.
- A window is always nice (reference the Toyota “window people” thing?)
