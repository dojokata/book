# Space, Time, Material

In this section we'll talk about the importance of dedicated space and the duration of a dojo challenge, the length of the challenge (time), and the materials and equipment you need to wrangle to run a dojo challenge both locally and remotely.

Challenge Spaces

Where the team challenge happens.

50 sq/ft/person is ideal - 20' x 20' space
60" or larger 4K LED + HDMI Display - Ideally on a rolling cart
Wall space for information radiators - 8' (non linear) x 4'
3-4 8'x4' Whiteboards - ideally mobile
A central table that seats the whole team
Optional: Additional monitors for pair programming
A table in front of the montior for mobbing
Cable management & power
Supplies bin - I have an Amazon list for common supplies - https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3GAGNGF3OD33I/ref=cm_wl_huc_title
Shallow tables on the periphery for team members to stow their bags, coats, lunch, etc.
Windows and natural light are a huge plus
Basket of toys and fun things to play.
