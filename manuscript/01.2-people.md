# People

Before you start you need alignment from three groups: active support and involvement leadership; commitment and engagement from teams engaging in a challenge; and capable coaches who are masters in their respective domains.


## Team Members {#members}

T-shaped teams. Small teams.

## Leaders {#leaders}

The dojo program leaders working with the team leaders.

## Coaches {#coaches}

- Player/Coaches.
- Disposition: action-biased; "show, don't tell."; teachers that do.

### External and Internal

> One of the things we hit upon was the quality of a host. That is, the role of the architect, or the designer, is that of a very good, thoughtful host, all of whose energy goes into trying to anticipate the needs of his guestsâ€”those who enter the building and use the objects in it. We decided that this was an essential ingredient in the design of a building or a useful object. - Charles Eames

Coming in as a coach from the outside can be a challenge. You don't know the domains. You don't know the business. You don't know the players.

Internal coaches have their own particular set of challenges. Their influence can be diminished because a team sees them everyday. This is unfortunate, but I've experienced for myself. A coaching coming in from the outside gets a few extra points. Maybe they're perceived as having industrial knowledge not readily accessible within the firm. Maybe it's that they're attached to a leader (air cover). I don't know, but it's definiately a thing.

## Supporting Community

- Shared capabilities.
- Communities of interest.
- Systemic stakeholders.
