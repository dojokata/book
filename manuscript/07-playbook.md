-# Playbook

"Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own." - Bruce Lee

"It depends" as a process. Plays are content. You'll have to decide which plays, in which order, fit into your context. Curating a set of plays for your dojo is a matter of thoughtful choice, iteration, experimentation, and reflection - all of which take time, all of which require acting in a purposeful way, collaborating with your team.

There's a heuristic in Object Oriented Programming (OO), "composition over inheritance." I like this for what we're trying to do in the dojo. We're not trying to create an "is a" relationship (inheritance) with a prescriptive workflow. We're trying to create a toolchain for learning with these plays - bringing them in at the right time to support a team's learning journey.
