THIS IS OLDER CONTENT I MAY OR MAY NOT USE.

“We are uncovering new ways of working by doing it,” so begins the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/), now going on two decades old. The declaration goes on to define several attributes that teams might focus on, but it’s this first part, the part that hints at evolving workflow by doing and reflecting on that workflow, that’s at the core of the dojo model.

Since 2015, a small group of people, myself included, have explored a new style of transformation, coaching, and upskilling. Transformation is a tricky word. It tends to trigger cynicism in those who have been around the block. However, there's no better word for what the dojo approach can do: take a large number of people, often in an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear, and work with them to build skills and capabilities that have a meaningful, measurable impact. Slowly, methodically, with intent: we're changing cultures from delivery, projects, and "when's it going to be done" to learning, products, and "I can't wait to see what's next."

The popular name for this method is a "dojo." A dojo, in its essence, is about a team finding their way into continuous improvement through the act of learning by doing, sharing, and reflecting. 

Getting to better products, teams, and culture requires investing in time, money, and attention. Transformation is like taking a title shot at project culture - the dominant heavyweight champion. Metrics such as velocity and capacity have their place but don't tell us how happy our customers and users are, what impact our actions have on generating revenue or saving costs, or how fulfilled our teammates are. 

Process makes a difference only when we treat it as an adaptable toolkit. Our workflow in the dojo is lightweight and mutable based on our context: the kinds of product outcomes you're seeking; the missions of your teams and growth of your people; the health, economic and psychological, of your enterprise. 

This book explains the benefits of the dojo model. We begin with an overview, "Enter the Dojo," grounding the approach with an overview of the method, principles that guide its design, and the kinds of people you'll need to build a capable team. 

You'll find a starter playbook that you can use to assemble a dojo program appropriate for your organization's transformation program. 

One of my goals for this book is to find the right blend of short and useful. It's organized as a manual for designing, launching, and running a dojo program. Use it as a starting point on your dojo journey, or use it to mine ideas that supplement what you're already doing.
