# Space, Equipment, Material

A big part of the dojo experience and why it works is the space. Having a dedicated team space can feel envigorating and energizing, especially coming from a cube farm or open office environment.

A dedicated space takes the team out of its normal environment and puts them in a new, more distraction free, environment that promotes focus.

The idea of a team room isn’t a new one. It’s been in the agile playbook for a long time. Before all this even was the Toyota Way idea of a [Obeya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obeya).

- A dedicated room is preferred. You do not want the challenge team’s space to be something walked through or routine. It's desirable to get people outside of their normal environment.
- Lots of wall space - we’re going to put up all kinds of displays and information radiators. We need space for things like frames, maps, etc.
- Readily available power outlets with tidy cable management.
- A window is always nice (reference the Toyota “window people” thing?)

## Equipment

- 1-2 60”+ 4k Display w/ HDMI. HDMI is the standard but we want to have a bin of adapters we’re likely to encounter. I think SMART displays are overkill as we typically want to display our workstation screens.
- Personal workstations.
- Dedicated environments or cloud accounts to be able to create environments.
- 27” class monitors for pairing. Again HDMI plus the bin of adapters.
- 4x 4’x8’ Dry Erase Board
