# Learning Forward

Learning-forward environment. Learn and teach by doing and through example.

Dial delivery back so we dial learning up.

Learning about:

* Our product.
* Our customers and users.
* Our architecture and design.
* Our team.
* Techniques and tools.
* Ourselves.

### Experimentation

In a challenge environment, team members are there to learn, to try new ways of working out for themselves. This requires a willingness to experiment on their product, themselves, and etc.
