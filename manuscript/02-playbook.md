This section shares common plays you might bring into your Dojo challenges. 

The problem with playbooks is people treat them as scripts. Rather, consider using this as a jumping off point to customize your Dojo or Dojo program to your exact needs. Each of these plays is presented as a suggestion in context that will help you satisfy (one or more Dojo principles)[principles]. 

This section is divided into several sub-sections:

0. Overview - a high-level overview of a multi-challenge Dojo with each play placed in context with when one might invoke it.

1. Challenge Plays - contains practices I use in every challenge I coach. This is your starter kit and if you're new to the Dojo model, you should start here. 

1. Program Plays - a few suggested practices if you're going to scale your Dojo challenge within a larger organization.

1. Leadership Plays - handy techniques for leaders who support challenge teams.

"It depends" as a process. Plays are content. You'll have to decide which plays, in which order, fit into your context. Curating a set of plays for your dojo is a matter of thoughtful choice, iteration, experimentation, and reflection - all of which take time, all of which require acting in a purposeful way, collaborating with your team.

There's a heuristic in Object Oriented Programming (OO), "composition over inheritance." I like this for what we're trying to do in the dojo. We're not trying to create an "is a" relationship (inheritance) with a prescriptive workflow. We're trying to create a toolchain for learning with these plays - bringing them in at the right time to support a team's learning journey.
