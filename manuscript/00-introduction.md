-# Introduction

“We are uncovering new ways of working by doing it,” so begins the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, now going on two decades old. The declaration goes on to define several attributes that teams might focus on, but it’s this first part, the part that hints at evolving workflow by doing and reflecting on that workflow, that’s at the core of the dojo model.

OPENING

PROBLEM STATEMENT

ALTERNATIVE TO
Getting to better products takes investment in time, money, and attention. Most of all it takes intent, vision, and followthrough. Transformation is hard to do under the persistent wardrum of delivery. Metrics such as velocity, capacity, etc. have their place, but don't tell us how happy our customers and users our, what impact we're having on revenue or cost, or how fulfilled our teammates really are. Process is important, but it's blest used in service of better products outcomes, the creativity of our people, and the health of our enterprise.

WHAT
At its heart, the dojo model is about transforming your teams through learning by doing. 

WHO
Before you start you need alignment from three groups: active support and involvement leadership; commitment and engagement from teams engaging in a challenge; and capable coaches who are masters in their respective domains.

This book explains the benefits of the dojo model, grounding the approach a few principles and roles. It also provides a playbook that you can use to assemble a dojo program appropriate for your organization's transformation program. Our goal was to make this manual mercifully short and useful. We hope you use it as a starting point to design your own dojo program and successfuly execute challenges.

I like a format of this for this section:

1. Start with a big, undeniable change that creates stakes.
2. Name the enemy.
3. Tease the "Promised Land."
4. Position capabilities as “magic” for slaying “monsters”
5. Present your best evidence.
