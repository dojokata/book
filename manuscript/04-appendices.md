# Common Metrics

Common success metrics teams might select to support learning outcomes and goals from framing. This is meant for coaches to open up a team's success measures to more quantitive evaluation. Please use these responsibly; you can't measure everything and no single measure will give you a complete picture of a dojo challenge team's success.
