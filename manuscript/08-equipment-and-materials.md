## Equipment

- 1-2 60”+ 4k Display w/ HDMI. HDMI is the standard but we want to have a bin of adapters we’re likely to encounter. I think SMART displays are overkill as we typically want to display our workstation screens.
- Personal workstations.
- Dedicated environments or cloud accounts to be able to create environments.
- 27” class monitors for pairing. Again HDMI plus the bin of adapters.
- 4x 4’x8’ Dry Erase Board
