-# Introduction

“We are uncovering new ways of working by doing it,” so begins the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, now going on two decades old. The declaration goes on to define several attributes that teams might focus on, but it’s this first part, the part that hints at evolving workflow by doing and reflecting on that workflow, that’s at the core of the dojo model.

Getting to agility takes an investment in time, money, and attention. It takes intent. Transformation is hard to do under the persistent wardrum of delivery. Metrics such as velocity, capacity, etc. have their place, but don't tell us a lot about how much learning we're doing.

The Dojo Model is about tranformation through learning by doing. To get there we need support and leadership. To get there we need commitment and engagement from the teams. To get there we need capable coaches who are masters in the domains they are coaching.
